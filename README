This program was designed as a scoring engine roughly equivalent to that used during the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).  This was developed so that students preparing for the competition can get a taste of what to expect.  While originally developed for use by students at the University of Texas at San Antonio, this program was open-sourced so others may use it as a tool in preparation for the competition.

If you find bugs or would like additional features, feel free to submit them via github.

For my purposes, the vagrantfile is enough to run this. 
I supposed one could git clone into /vagrant. Then run /vagrant/bootstrap.sh and it would work.

Just browse to setup.php and it will create the database, tables, and import a default sql dump file.

add cron for the pollers when ready
* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/controller.php >> /var/www/cronout.log
